# PHP RPI-WS2812-Client
The PHP WS2812 Client is an object oriented PHP library for driving programmable LEDs like the WS2812 or SK9822 from your Raspberry Pi. It uses the Raspberry Pi WS2812 server by tom-2015 ([https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server ](https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server )), which is in-turn based on the rpi_ws281x PWM driver library from jgarff ([https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)).
